# todos demo

A simple web service for storing/retrieving daily todos.

It's intended to demonstrate the use of [buckets](https://github.com/joyrexus/buckets) for persistence in a web service context.  See the buckets [examples directory](https://github.com/joyrexus/buckets/examples) for additional demos.

Run the demo to see the service in action:

    go get github.com/joyrexus/todos
    cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/joyrexus/todos/demo
    go run main.go
